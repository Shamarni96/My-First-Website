## Welcome!

This is my first website. On this page, I will be explaining some key points about _agile_ and _scrum_ In software engineering.

Agile is essentially a process in which you work towards shorter term goals and get them done, implementing them into the program and allowing the client(user) to use the program even though it is not finished.

Scrum is an agile project management framework that teams use to develop, deliver and sustain complex products.
Agile is a mindset. Scrum is a way of working.
