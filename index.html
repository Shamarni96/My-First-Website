    <h1>Agile and Scrum</h1>
    <hr>

    <p> id="intro" This is my first website. On this page,
        <br>
        <br>
        I will be explaining some key points about <em>agile</em> and <em>Scrum</em>
        <br>
        in software engineering.</p>

    <div>
    <h2>Agile</h2>
    <h3>What is agile?</h3>

    <p>Agile is essentially a process in which you work towards shorter term goals and get them done,
        <br>
        implementing them into the program and allowing the client(user) to use the program even though it is not
        finished.</p>

    <h2>Scrum</h2>
    <h3>What is scrum?</h3>

    <p>Scrum is an agile project management framework that teams use to develop,
        <br>
        deliver and sustain complex products.
        <br>
        Agile is a mindset. Scrum is a way of working.</p>
    </div>

<h3>Scrum methods</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Sprints</li>
    <li>Ceremonies</li>
    <li>Backlogs</li>
    <li>Standups</li>
    <li>Sprint reviews</li>
    <li>Retrospectives</li>
</ul>

<h4>Sprints</h4>

<p>A product is built in a series of iterations called sprints,
this breaks down big complex projects into bit sized pieces to help make the projects
more manageable. It also allows teams to ship high quality work faster and more frequently and
gives them more flexability to adapt.
