        <h1>Welcome!</h1>

        <p>This is my first website. On this page, 
            <br>
            I will be explaining some key points about <em>agile</em> and <em>Scrum</em> 
            <br>
            in software engineering.</p>
        
        <h2>Agile</h2>
        <h3>What is agile?</h3> 
        
        <p>Agile is essentially a process in which you work towards shorter term goals and get them done,
          <br>  
            implementing them into the program and allowing the client(user) to use the program even though it is not finished.</p>

       <h2>Scrum</h2> 
        <h3>What is scrum?</h3> 
        
        <p>Scrum is an agile project management framework that teams use to develop, 
            <br>
            deliver and sustain complex products.
            <br>
        Agile is a mindset. Scrum is a way of working.</p>
